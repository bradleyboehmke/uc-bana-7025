1. Identify which working directory you are working out of.

2. Create a folder on your computer titled _Learning R_. Within RStudio, set your working directory to this folder.

3. Type `pi` in the console. Set the option to show 8 digits. Re-type `pi` in the console.

4. Type `?pi` in the console. Note that documentation on this object pops up in the Help tab in the Misc. Display.

5. Now check out your code History tab.

6. Create a new .R file and save this as _my-first-script_ (note how this now appears in your _Learning R_ folder). Type `pi` in line 1 of this script, `option(digits = 8)` in line 2, and `pi` again in line three. Execute this code one line at a time and then re-execute all lines at once.

# Getting Help

.pull-left[

### In general

* __Google__: just add "with R" at the end of any search
* __Stack Overflow__: focused on programming questions
* __Cross Validated__: focused on statistical questions
* __RStudio Community__: a community for all things R and RStudio.

### FOMO

* __R-bloggers__: blog aggregator
* __Twitter__: #rstats

### Within R

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# provides details for specific function
help(sqrt)
?sqrt #<<

# provides examples for said function

1. Does `help.start()` provide a link to an introduction to R manual?

2. Does R's `mode` function compute the statistical mode?

3. Review at least 5 [Stack Overflow questions about R](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r).

- R will try to explain why there’s a warning. 

- Generally your code will still work, but with some caveats.
