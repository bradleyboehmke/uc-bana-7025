# (PART) Module 3 {-}

# Overview

In the last module we discussed general guidelines for first interacting with a new data set. In module 3 we want to build on those activities by learning how to clean and tidy our data, and then beginning our journey to creating insights with data through data manipulation.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Explain the basic concepts of "tidy" data.
- Perform data tidying tasks with R such as reshaping, splitting, and combining data along with handling missing values.
- Manipulate your data by applying filters, selecting and renaming columns, creating new variables, and more.
- Compute descriptive statistics across all observations and within different grouped levels of observations.
