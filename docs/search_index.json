The following is a truncated syllabus; for the full syllabus along with complete course content please visit the online course content in Canvas. Welcome to Data Wrangling with R! This course provides an intensive, hands-on introduction to Data Wrangling with the R programming language. You will learn the fundamental skills required to acquire, munge, transform, manipulate, and visualize data in a computing environment that fosters reproducibility. Data wrangling, which is also commonly referred to as data munging, transformation, manipulation, janitor work, etc. can be a painstakingly laborious process. In fact, it has been stated that up to 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing data (Wickham 2014; Dasu and Johnson 2003). However, being a prerequisite to the rest of the data analysis workflow (visualization, modeling, reporting), it’s essential that you become fluent and efficient in data wrangling techniques. Learning Objectives This course will guide you through the data wrangling process along with give you a solid foundation of the basics of working with data in R. My goal is to teach you how to easily wrangle your data so you can spend more time focused on understanding the content of your data via visualization, modeling, and reporting your results. Upon successfully completing this course, you will be able to: Perform your data analysis in a literate programming environment Manage different types of data Manage different data structures Import and export data Index, subset, reshape and transform your data Compute descriptive statistics Visualize data Make your code efficient by using control statements &amp; iteration Write your own functions …all with R! This course assumes no prior knowledge of R. Experience with programming concepts or another programming language will help, but is not required to understand the material. Material The bulk of the classroom material will be provided via this book, the recorded lectures, and class notes. In some cases there are additional recommended readings, all of which are readily available online. Class Structure Modules: For this class each module is covered over the course of week. In the “Overview” section for each module you will find overall learning objectives, a short description of the learning content covered in that module, along with all tasks that are required of you for that module (i.e. quizzes, lab). Each module will have two or more primary lessons and associated quizzes along with a lab. Lessons: For each lesson you will read and work through the tutorial. Short videos will be sprinkled throughout the lesson to further discuss and reinforce lesson concepts. Each lesson will have various “Your Turn” exercises throughout, along with end-of-lesson exercises. I highly recommend you work through these exercises as they will prepare you for the quizzes, labs, and project work. Quizzes: There will be a short quiz associated with each lesson. These quizzes will be hosted in the course website on Canvas. Please check Canvas for due dates for these quizzes. Labs: There will be a lab associated with each module. For these labs students will be guided through a case study step-by-step. The aim is to provide a detailed view on how to manage a variety of complex real-world data; how to convert real problems into data wrangling and analysis problems; and to apply R to address these problems and extract insights from the data. Submission of these labs will be done through the course website on Canvas. Please check Canvas for due dates for these labs. Project: TBD Schedule See the Canvas course webpage for a detailed schedule with due dates for quizzes, labs, etc. Module Description 1 Introduction Intro to data wrangling, R, and this course R fundamentals &amp; the Rstudio IDE 2 Reproducible Documents and Importing Data Managing your workflow and reproducibility Importing data and understanding the basics of it 3 Tidy Data and Data Manipulation Tidying &amp; preparing data for analysis Data manipulation 4 Relational Data and More Tidyverse Packages Relational data Leveraging the Tidyverse to simplify data wrangling 5 Data Visualization &amp; Exploration Data visualization Exploratory data analysis 6 Creating Efficient Code in R Control statements &amp; iteration Writing functions 7 Introduction to Applied Modeling Correlation &amp; pattern discovery Introduction to machine learning Conventions used in this book The following typographical conventions are used in this book: strong italic: indicates new terms, bold: indicates package &amp; file names, inline code: monospaced highlighted text indicates functions or other commands that could be typed literally by the user, code chunk: indicates commands or other text that could be typed literally by the user 1 + 2 ## [1] 3 In addition to the general text used throughout, you will notice the following cells that provide additional context for improved learning: A tip or suggestion that will likely produce better results.

It will also provide you with some tips for getting help as you start writing R code and differentiating errors, warnings, and messages (because we will experience these daily!). 3.1 Learning objectives Upon completing this module you will: Understand the difference between R and RStudio. Have R and RStudio installed on your computer. Be able to navigate the RStudio IDE. Know how to get help as you first start learning R. Differentiate errors, warnings, and messages. Know what additional resources are available to go deeper. 3.2 R vs. RStudio When students first learn about R and RStudio, they are often confused on how the two differentiate. R is a programming language that runs computations, while RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. An analogy used by Ismay and Kim (2019) helps put this into perspective. “R is like a car’s engine while RStudio is like a car’s dashboard…just as the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio’s interface makes using R much easier as well.” Figure 3.1: Analogy of difference between R and RStudio (Ismay and Kim 2019) It is important to note that one can write R and do nearly everything you are going to do in this course without using RStudio. However, RStudio has lots of features that make writing, executing, and organizing your R code so much easier. Moreover, realize that there are other IDEs and platforms that you can use (i.e. VS code, Radiant, jupyter) to write and execute R code; however, RStudio has become the defacto IDE for R and is heavily used throughout the R community. Since RStudio has lots of features, it takes time to learn them. A good resource to learn more about RStudio are the R Studio Essentials collection of videos. 3.3 Installing R and RStudio It is important that you install R first and then install RStudio. You can download and install R from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. It is highly recommended to install a precompiled binary distribution for your operating system (OS); follow these instructions: Go to https://cloud.r-project.org/ Select the installer for your operating system: If you are a Windows user: Click on “Download R for Windows”, then click on “base”, then click on the Download link. If you are macOS user: Click on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”, then under “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of April 25, 2022 was R-4.2.0. If you are a Linux user: Click on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup. Follow the instructions of the installer. Next, you can download RStudio’s IDE by following these instructions: Go to RStudio for desktop https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Scroll down to “Installers for Supported Platforms” near the bottom of the page. Select the install file for your OS. Follow the instructions of the installer. Installing R and RStudio should be fairly straightforward. However, a great set of detailed step-by-step instructions is in Rafael Irizarry’s Introduction to Data Science book (Irizarry 2019). After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you’ll have two new programs (also called applications) you can open. The R application icon looks like the left image below while the RStudio icon looks like the right image. We’ll always work in RStudio and not in the R application so be sure to select the correct icon. Figure 3.2: Use the RStudio icon (right) and not the R icon (left) to launch your R project. (Ismay and Kim 2019) If your OS allows, pin the RStudio icon to your desktop or Dock and keep the R icon in another location (i.e. Applications for Mac users). This makes it natural and efficient to always go to the RStudio icon on your desktop for launching the program. After you open RStudio, you should see something similar to the following image. Note that slight differences might exist depending on the version of your RStudio interface. Figure 3.3: RStudio interface to R. You are now ready to start programming! 3.4 Understanding the RStudio IDE The RStudio IDE is where all the action happens. There are four fundamental windows in the IDE, each with their own purpose. I discuss each briefly below but I highly suggest Oscar Torres-Reyna’s Introduction to RStudio for a thorough understanding of the console1. Figure 3.4: The four fundamental windows within the RStudio IDE 3.4.1 Script Editor The top left window is where your script files will display. There are multiple forms of script files but the basic one to start with is the .R file. To create a new file you use the File » New File menu. To open an existing file you use either the File » Open File… menu or the Recent Files menu to select from recently opened files. RStudio’s source editor includes a variety of productivity enhancing features including syntax highlighting, code completion, multiple-file editing, and find/replace. A good introduction to the script editor was written by RStudio’s Josh Paulson2. The script editor is a great place to put code you care about. Keep experimenting in the console, but once you have written code that works and does what you want, put it in the script editor. RStudio will automatically save the contents of the editor when you quit RStudio, and will automatically load it when you re-open. Nevertheless, it’s a good idea to save your scripts regularly and to back them up. To execute the code in the script editor you have two options: Place the cursor on the line that you would like to execute and execute Cmd/Ctrl + Enter. Alternatively, you could hit the Run button in the toolbar. If you want to run all lines of code in the script then you can highlight the lines you want to run and then execute one of the options in #1. Figure 3.5: Execute lines of code in your script with Cmd/Ctrl + Enter or using the Run button. 3.4.2 Workspace Environment The top right window is the workspace environment which captures much of your your current R working environment and includes any user-defined objects (vectors, matrices, data frames, lists, functions). When saving your R working session, these are the components along with the script files that will be saved in your working directory, which is the default location for all file inputs and outputs. To get or set your working directory so you can direct where your files are saved: # returns path for the current working directory getwd() # set the working directory to a specified directory setwd(&quot;path/of/directory&quot;) For example, if I call getwd() the file path “/Users/b294776/Desktop” is returned. If I want to set the working directory to the “Workspace” folder within the “Desktop” directory I would use setwd(\"/Users/b294776/Desktop/Workspace\"). Now if I call getwd() again it returns “/Users/b294776/Desktop/Workspace”. An alternative solution is to go to the following location in your toolbar Session » Set Working Directory » Choose Directory and select the directory of choice (much easier!). The workspace environment will also list your user defined objects such as vectors, matrices, data frames, lists, and functions. For example, if you type the following in your console: x &lt;- 2 y &lt;- 3 You will now see x and y listed in your workspace environment. To identify or remove the objects (i.e. vectors, data frames, user defined functions, etc.) in your current R environment: # list all objects ls() # identify if an R object with a given name is present exists(&quot;x&quot;) # remove defined object from the environment rm(x) # you can remove multiple objects rm(x, y) # basically removes everything in the working environment -- use with caution! rm(list = ls()) If you have a lot of objects in your workspace environment you can use the 🧹 icon in the workspace environment tab to clear out everything. You can also view previous commands in the workspace environment by clicking the History tab, by simply pressing the up arrow on your keyboard, or by typing into the console: # default shows 25 most recent commands history() # show 100 most recent commands history(100) # show entire saved history history(Inf) 3.4.3 Console The bottom left window contains the console. You can code directly in this window but it will not save your code. It is best to use this window when you are simply wanting to perform calculator type functions. This is also where your outputs will be presented when you run code in your script. Go ahead and type the following in your console: 2 * 3 + 8 / 2 3.4.4 Misc. Displays The bottom right window contains multiple tabs. The Files tab allows you to see which files are available in your working directory. The Plots tab will display any plots/graphics that are produced by your code. The Packages tab will list all packages downloaded to your computer and also the ones that are loaded (more on this later). And the Help tab allows you to search for topics you need help on and will also display any help responses (more on this later as well). 3.4.5 Workspace Options &amp; Shortcuts There are multiple options available for you to set and customize both R and your RStudio console. For R, you can read about, and set, available options for the current R session with the following code. For now you don’t need to worry about making any adjustments, just know that many options do exist. # learn about available options help(options) # view current option settings options() # change a specific option (i.e. number of digits to print on output) options(digits=3) For a thorough tutorial regarding the RStudio console and how to customize different components check out this tutorial. You can also find the RStudio console cheatsheet shown below by going to Help menu » Cheatsheets. As with most computer programs, there are numerous keyboard shortcuts for working with the console. To access a menu displaying all the shortcuts in RStudio you can use option + shift + k. Within RStudio you can also access them in the Help menu » Keyboard Shortcuts Help. Figure 3.6: RStudio IDE cheat sheet. 3.4.6 Knowledge check Identify which working directory you are working out of. Create a folder on your computer titled Learning R. Within RStudio, set your working directory to this folder. Type pi in the console. Set the option to show 8 digits. Re-type pi in the console. Type ?pi in the console. Note that documentation on this object pops up in the Help tab in the Misc. Display. Now check out your code History tab. Create a new .R file and save this as my-first-script (note how this now appears in your Learning R folder). Type pi in line 1 of this script, option(digits = 8) in line 2, and pi again in line three. Execute this code one line at a time and then re-execute all lines at once. 3.5 Getting help The help documentation and support in R is comprehensive and easily accessible from the the console. 3.5.1 General Help To leverage general help resources you can use: # provides general help links help.start() # searches the help system for documentation matching a given character string help.search(&quot;linear regression&quot;) Note that the help.search(\"some text here\") function requires a character string enclosed in quotation marks. So if you are in search of time series functions in R, using help.search(\"time series\") will pull up a healthy list of vignettes and code demonstrations that illustrate packages and functions that work with time series data. For more direct help on functions that are installed on your computer you can use the following. Test these out in your console: help(mean) # provides details for specific function ?mean # provides same information as help(functionname) example(mean) # provides examples for said function Note that the help() and ? function calls only work for functions within loaded packages. You’ll understand what this means shortly. 3.5.2 Getting Help From the Web Typically, a problem you may be encountering is not new and others have faced, solved, and documented the same issue online. The following resources can be used to search for online help. Although, I typically just Google the problem and find answers relatively quickly. RSiteSearch(\"key phrase\"): searches for the key phrase in help manuals and archived mailing lists on the R Project website. Stack Overflow: a searchable Q&amp;A site oriented toward programming issues. 75% of my answers typically come from Stack Overflow. Cross Validated: a searchable Q&amp;A site oriented toward statistical analysis. RStudio Community: a community for all things R and RStudio where you can get direct answers to your problems and also give back by helping to solve and answer other’s questions. R-seek: a Google custom search that is focused on R-specific websites R-bloggers: a central hub of content collected from over 500 bloggers who provide news and tutorials about R. Twitter has a thriving R community (#rstats) and is definitely worth following. However, it is not the place to ask for help on specific code functionality. 3.5.3 Knowledge check Does help.start() provide a link to an introduction to R manual? Does R’s mode function compute the statistical mode? Review at least 5 Stack Overflow questions about R. 3.6 Errors, warnings, and messages One thing that intimidates new R users (and new programmers in general) is when they run into errors, warnings, and messages. R reports errors, warnings, and messages in the following way. Don’t worry about what the code is doing, just get familiar with the differences in how errors, warnings, and messages are reported. Errors: When the red text is a legitimate error, it will be prefaced with “Error in…” and will try to explain what went wrong. Generally when there’s an error, the code will not run. Think of errors as a red traffic light: something is wrong! For references on common errors, check out the following links by Noam Ross, David Smith, and Chester Ismay. # Example of an error 1 + &#39;a&#39; ## Error in 1 + &quot;a&quot;: non-numeric argument to binary operator Warnings: Warning messages will be prefaced with “Warning:” and R will try to explain why there’s a warning. Generally your code will still work, but with some caveats. Think of warnings as a yellow traffic light: everything is working, but watch out/pay attention. Typically when you get a warning you want to figure out what is throwing the warning because the end result may not be what you had intended! x &lt;- 1:2 y &lt;- 1:3 # Example of a warning x + y ## Warning in x + y: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length ## [1] 2 4 4 Messages: When the text doesn’t start with either “Error” or “Warning”, it’s just a friendly message. You’ll often see these messages when you load R packages or make certain function calls. Think of messages as a green traffic light: everything is working fine and keep on going! # Example of a message library(completejourney) ## Welcome to the completejourney package! Learn more about these data ## sets at http://bit.ly/completejourney. 3.7 Exercises What differentiates R and RStudio? What are the four main panes in RStudio? What function tells you what directory your are operating in? How could you change the directory to a new folder? How could you access R documentation to learn more about the lm() function? References "],["lesson-1c-r-fundamentals.html", "4 Lesson 1c: R fundamentals 4.1 Learning objectives 4.2 Assignment &amp; evaluation 4.3 R as a calculator 4.4 Working with packages 4.5 Style guide 4.6 Exercises", " 4 Lesson 1c: R fundamentals This lesson serves to introduce you to many of the basics of R to get you comfortable. This includes understanding how to assign and evaluate expressions, performing basic calculator-like activities, the idea of vectorization and packages. Finally, I offer some basic styling guidelines to help you write code that is easier to digest by others. 4.1 Learning objectives Upon completing this module you will be able to: Assign values to variables and evaluate them. Perform basic mathematical operations. Explain what packages and be able to install and load them. Understand and apply basic styling guidelines to your code. 4.2 Assignment &amp; evaluation 4.2.1 Assignment The first operator you’ll run into is the assignment operator. The assignment operator is used to assign a value. For instance we can assign the value 3 to the variable x using the &lt;- assignment operator. # idiomatic assignment x &lt;- 3 R is a dynamically typed programming language which means it will perform the process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types at run-time. If you are unfamiliar with dynamically versus statically-typed languages then do not worry about this detail. Just realize that dynamically typed languages allow for the simplicity of running the above command and R automatically inferring that 3 should be a numeric type rather than a character string. Interestingly, R actually allows for five assignment operators3: # leftward assignment x &lt;- value x = value x &lt;&lt;- value # rightward assignment value -&gt; x value -&gt;&gt; x The original assignment operator in R was &lt;- and has continued to be the preferred among R users. The = assignment operator was added in 2001 primarily because it is the accepted assignment operator in many other languages and beginners to R coming from other languages were so prone to use it. Using = is not wrong, just realize that most R programmers prefer to keep = reserved for argument association and use &lt;- for assignment. The operators &lt;&lt;- is normally only used in functions or looping constructs which we will not get into the details. And the rightward assignment operators perform the same as their leftward counterparts, they just assign the value in an opposite direction. Overwhelmed yet? Don’t be. This is just meant to show you that there are options and you will likely come across them sooner or later. My suggestion is to stick with the tried, true, and idiomatic &lt;- operator. This is the most conventional assignment operator used and is what you will find in all the base R source code…which means it should be good enough for you. 4.2.2 Evaluation We can then evaluate the variable by simply typing x at the command line which will return the value of x. Note that prior to the value returned you’ll see ## [1] in the console. This simply implies that the output returned is the first output. Note that you can type any comments in your code by preceding the comment with the hash tag (#) symbol. Any values, symbols, and texts following # will not be evaluated. # evaluation x ## [1] 3 4.2.3 Case Sensitivity Lastly, note that R is a case sensitive programming language. Meaning all variables, functions, and objects must be called by their exact spelling: x &lt;- 1 y &lt;- 3 z &lt;- 4 x * y * z ## [1] 12 x * Y * z ## Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object &#39;Y&#39; not found 4.2.4 Knowledge check Assign the value 5 to variable x (note how this shows up in your Global Environment). Assign the character “abc” to variable y. Evaluate the value of x and y at in the console. Now use the rm() function to remove these objects from you working environment. 4.3 R as a calculator 4.3.1 Basic Arithmetic At its most basic function R can be used as a calculator. When applying basic arithmetic, the PEMDAS order of operations applies: parentheses first followed by exponentiation, multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction. 8 + 9 / 5 ^ 2 ## [1] 8.36 8 + 9 / (5 ^ 2) ## [1] 8.36 8 + (9 / 5) ^ 2 ## [1] 11.24 (8 + 9) / 5 ^ 2 ## [1] 0.68 By default R will display seven digits but this can be changed using options() as previously outlined. 1 / 7 ## [1] 0.14286 options(digits = 3) 1 / 7 ## [1] 0.143 Also, large numbers will be expressed in scientific notation which can also be adjusted using options(). 888888 * 888888 ## [1] 7.9e+11 options(digits = 10) 888888 * 888888 ## [1] 790121876544 Note that the largest number of digits that can be displayed is 22. Requesting any larger number of digits will result in an error message. pi ## [1] 3.141592654 options(digits = 22) pi ## [1] 3.141592653589793115998 options(digits = 23) ## Error in options(digits = 23): invalid &#39;digits&#39; parameter, allowed 0...22 pi ## [1] 3.141592653589793115998 We can also perform integer divide (%/%) and modulo (%%) functions. The integer divide function will give the integer part of a fraction while the modulo will provide the remainder. # regular division 42 / 4 ## [1] 10.5 # integer division 42 %/% 4 ## [1] 10 # modulo (remainder) 42 %% 4 ## [1] 2 4.3.2 Miscellaneous Mathematical Functions There are many built-in functions to be aware of. These include but are not limited to the following. Go ahead and run this code in your console. x &lt;- 10 abs(x) # absolute value sqrt(x) # square root exp(x) # exponential transformation log(x) # logarithmic transformation cos(x) # cosine and other trigonometric functions 4.3.3 Infinite, and NaN Numbers When performing undefined calculations, R will produce Inf (infinity) and NaN (not a number) outputs. These can easily pop up in regular data wrangling tasks and later modules will discuss how to work with these types of outputs along with missing values. # infinity 1 / 0 ## [1] Inf # infinity minus infinity Inf - Inf ## [1] NaN # negative infinity -1 / 0 ## [1] -Inf # not a number 0 / 0 ## [1] NaN # square root of -9 sqrt(-9) ## Warning in sqrt(-9): NaNs produced ## [1] NaN 4.3.4 Knowledge check Assign the values 1000, 5, and 0.05 to variables D, K, and h respectively. Compute \\(2 \\times D \\times K\\). Compute \\(\\frac{2 \\times D \\times K}{h}\\). Now put this together to compute the Economic Order Quantity, which is \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times D \\times K}{h}}\\). Save the output as Q. 4.4 Working with packages In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package. A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests and provides an easy method to share with others (Wickham 2015). As of April 2022 there were nearly 19,000 packages available on CRAN, 2,000 on Bioconductor, and countless more available through GitHub. This huge variety of packages is one of the reasons that R is so successful: chances are that someone has already solved a problem that you’re working on, and you can benefit from their work by downloading and using their package. 4.4.1 Installing Packages The most common place to get packages is from CRAN. To install packages from CRAN you use install.packages(\"packagename\"). For instance, if you want to install the ggplot2 package, which is a very popular visualization package you would type the following in the console: # install package from CRAN install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) As previously stated, packages are also available through Bioconductor and GitHub. Bioconductor provides R packages primarily for genomic data analyses and packages on GitHub are usually under development but have not gone through all the checks and balances to be loaded onto CRAN (aka download and use these packages at your discretion). You can learn how to install Bioconductor packages here and GitHub packages here. 4.4.2 Loading Packages Once the package is downloaded to your computer you can access the functions and resources provided by the package in two different ways: # load the package to use in the current R session library(packagename) # use a particular function within a package without loading the package packagename::functionname For instance, if you want to have full access to the dplyr package you would use library(dplyr); however, if you just wanted to use the filter() function which is provided by the dplyr package without fully loading dplyr you can use dplyr::filter(...)4. 4.4.3 Getting Help on Packages For more direct help on packages that are installed on your computer you can use the help and vignette functions. Here we can get help on the ggplot2 package with the following: help(package = &quot;ggplot2&quot;) # provides details regarding contents of a package vignette(package = &quot;ggplot2&quot;) # list vignettes available for a specific package vignette(&quot;ggplot2-specs&quot;) # view specific vignette vignette() # view all vignettes on your computer Note that some packages will have multiple vignettes. For instance vignette(package = \"grid\") will list the 13 vignettes available for the grid package. To access one of the specific vignettes you simply use vignette(\"vignettename\"). 4.4.4 Useful Packages There are thousands of helpful R packages for you to use, but navigating them all can be a challenge. To help you out, RStudio compiled a guide to some of the best packages for loading, manipulating, visualizing, analyzing, and reporting data. In addition, their list captures packages that specialize in spatial data, time series and financial data, increasing spead and performance, and developing your own R packages. 4.4.5 Knowledge check Install the completejourney package. Load the completejourney package. Access the help documentation for the completejourney package. Check out the vignette(s) for completejourney. Call the get_transactions() function provided by completejourney and save the output to a transactions variable (note that this takes a little time as you are trying to download 1.5 million transactions!). 4.4.6 Tidyverse The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures; and this group of packages has become extremely popular and common across the data science community. You will learn about many of these packages throughout this course. Take a little time to familiarize yourself with the Tidyverse. Not only will you find high-level descriptions of the different tidyverse packages but you will also find a lot of educational content that you can and should take advantage of! Figure 4.1: Tidyverse is a collection of packages designed to simplify many tasks throughout the data analysis process. Let’s go ahead and install the tidyverse package, which will actually install a bunch of other packages for us. install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) The single line of code above 👆… is equivalent to running the 29 lines of code below 👇! install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tibble&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tidyr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;readr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;purrr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;stringr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;forcats&quot;) install.packages(&quot;cli&quot;) install.packages(&quot;crayon&quot;) install.packages(&quot;dbplyr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;dtplyr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;googledrive&quot;) install.packages(&quot;googlesheets4&quot;) install.packages(&quot;haven&quot;) install.packages(&quot;hms&quot;) install.packages(&quot;httr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;jsonlite&quot;) install.packages(&quot;lubridate&quot;) install.packages(&quot;magrittr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;modelr&quot;) install.packages(&quot;pillar&quot;) install.packages(&quot;readxl&quot;) install.packages(&quot;reprex&quot;) install.packages(&quot;rlang&quot;) install.packages(&quot;rstudioapi&quot;) install.packages(&quot;rvest&quot;) install.packages(&quot;xml2&quot;) If we load the tidyverse package we will see that it loads 8 packages for us: ggplot2_, tibble, tidyr, readr, purrr, dplyr, stringr, and forcats. These are packages that we will tend to use in almost any data analysis project. library(tidyverse) The single line of code above 👆… is equivalent to running the 8 lines of code below 👇! library(ggplot2) library(tibble) library(tidyr) library(readr) library(purrr) library(dplyr) library(stringr) library(forcats) 4.5 Style guide “Good coding style is like using correct punctuation. You can manage without it, but it sure makes things easier to read.” - Hadley Wickham As a medium of communication, its important to realize that the readability of code does in fact make a difference. Well styled code has many benefits to include making it easy to i) read, ii) extend, and iii) debug. Unfortunately, R does not come with official guidelines for code styling but such is an inconvenient truth of most open source software. However, this should not lead you to believe there is no style to be followed and over time implicit guidelines for proper code styling have been documented. What follows are a few of the basic guidelines from the tidyverse style guide. These suggestions will help you get started with good styling suggestions as you begin this book but as you progress you should leverage the far more detailed tidyverse style guide along with useful packages such as lintr and styler to help enforce good code syntax on yourself. 4.5.1 Notation and Naming File names should be meaningful and end with a .R extension. # Good weather-analysis.R emerson-text-analysis.R lesson-1b-homework.R # Bad basic-stuff.r detail.r If files need to be run in sequence, prefix them with numbers: 0-download.R 1-preprocessing.R 2-explore.R 3-fit-model.R In R, naming conventions for variables and functions are famously muddled. They include the following: namingconvention # all lower case; no separator naming.convention # period separator naming_convention # underscore separator (aka snake case) namingConvention # lower camel case NamingConvention # upper camel case Historically, there has been no clearly preferred approach with multiple naming styles sometimes used within a single package. Bottom line, your naming convention will be driven by your preference but the ultimate goal should be consistency. Vast majority of the R community uses lowercase with an underscore (“_“) to separate words within a variable/function name (‘snake_case’). Furthermore, variable names should be nouns and function names should be verbs to help distinguish their purpose. Also, refrain from using existing names of functions (i.e. mean, sum, true). 4.5.2 Organization Organization of your code is also important. There’s nothing like trying to decipher 500 lines of code that has no organization. The easiest way to achieve organization is to comment your code. When you have large sections within your script you should separate them to make it obvious of the distinct purpose of the code. # Download Data ------------------------------------------------------------------- lines of code here # Preprocess Data ----------------------------------------------------------------- lines of code here # Exploratory Analysis ------------------------------------------------------------ lines of code here You can easily add these section breaks within RStudio wth Cmd+Shift+R. Then comments for specific lines of code can be done as follows: code_1 # short comments can be placed to the right of code code_2 # blah code_3 # blah # or comments can be placed above a line of code code_4 # Or extremely long lines of commentary that go beyond the suggested 80 # characters per line can be broken up into multiple lines. Just don&#39;t forget # to use the hash on each. code_5 You can easily comment or uncomment lines by highlighting the line and then pressing Cmd+Shift+C. 4.5.3 Syntax The maximum number of characters on a single line of code should be 80 or less. If you are using RStudio you can have a margin displayed so you know when you need to break to a new line5. Also, when indenting your code use two spaces rather than using tabs. The only exception is if a line break occurs inside parentheses. In this case it is common to do either of the following: # option 1 super_long_name &lt;- seq(ymd_hm(&quot;2015-1-1 0:00&quot;), ymd_hm(&quot;2015-1-1 12:00&quot;), by = &quot;hour&quot;) # option 2 super_long_name &lt;- seq( ymd_hm(&quot;2015-1-1 0:00&quot;), ymd_hm(&quot;2015-1-1 12:00&quot;), by = &quot;hour&quot; ) Proper spacing within your code also helps with readability. Place spaces around all infix operators (=, +, -, &lt;-, etc.). The same rule applies when using = in function calls. Always put a space after a comma, and never before. # Good average &lt;- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE) # Bad average&lt;-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE) There’s a small exception to this rule: :, :: and ::: don’t need spaces around them. # Good x &lt;- 1:10 base::get # Bad x &lt;- 1 : 10 base :: get It is important to think about style when communicating any form of language. Writing code is no exception and is especially important if your code will be read by others. Following these basic style guides will get you on the right track for writing code that can be easily communicated to others. 4.5.4 Knowledge check Review chapters 1 &amp; 2 in the Tidyverse Style Guide. Go back through the script you’ve been writing to execute the exercises in this module and make sure your naming conventions are consistent, your code is nicely organized and annotated, your syntax includes proper spacing. 4.6 Exercises Say you have a 12” pizza. Compute the area of the pizza and assign that value to the variable area. Now say the cost of the pizza was $8. Compute the cost per square inch and assign that value to a variable ppsi. Based on the style guide section rename the ppsi variable in question 1 to be more meaningful. If you did not already do so, install the tidyverse package.

This is great; however, we were only working with individual values. Often, we want to work on several values at once so we need a structure that will hold multiple pieces of data. We will discuss data structures more in the next module but in this lesson we introduce the vector, which is the fundamental data structure in R. Once you have a good grasp of working with vectors, then working with other data structures because much easier. 5.1 Learning objectives By the end of this lesson you will be able to: Create vectors. Extract and replace elements within a vector. Perform basic operations on a vector (i.e. compute the mean). Work with missing data in a vector. Explain and take advantage of vectorization. 5.2 Creating vectors There are multiple ways to create vectors but the first one you’ll be introduced to is by using c(). The c() function is short for concatenate and we use it to join together a series of values and store them in a vector. my_vec &lt;- c(2, 3, 1, 6, 4, 3, 3, 7) To examine the value of our new object we can simply type out the name of the object as we did before: my_vec ## [1] 2 3 1 6 4 3 3 7 5.2.1 Creating sequences Sometimes it can be useful to create a vector that contains a regular sequence of values in steps of one. Here we can make use of a shortcut using the : symbol. my_seq &lt;- 1:10 # create regular sequence my_seq ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 my_seq2 &lt;- 10:1 # in decending order my_seq2 ## [1] 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Other useful functions for generating vectors of sequences include the seq() and rep() functions. For example, to generate a sequence from 1 to 5 in steps of 0.5 my_seq2 &lt;- seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 0.5) my_seq2 ## [1] 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 Here we’ve used the arguments from = and to = to define the limits of the sequence and the by = argument to specify the increment of the sequence. Play around with other values for these arguments to see their effect. The rep() function allows you to replicate (repeat) values a specified number of times. To repeat the value 2, 10 times # repeats 2, 10 times my_seq3 &lt;- rep(2, times = 10) my_seq3 ## [1] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 You can also repeat non-numeric values # repeats ‘abc’ 3 times my_seq4 &lt;- rep(&quot;abc&quot;, times = 3) my_seq4 ## [1] &quot;abc&quot; &quot;abc&quot; &quot;abc&quot; or each element of a series # repeats the series 1 to 5, 3 times my_seq5 &lt;- rep(1:5, times = 3) my_seq5 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 or elements of a series # repeats each element of the series 3 times my_seq6 &lt;- rep(1:5, each = 3) my_seq6 ## [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 We can also repeat a non-sequential series # repeats each element of the series 3 times my_seq7 &lt;- rep(c(3, 1, 10, 7), each = 3) my_seq7 ## [1] 3 3 3 1 1 1 10 10 10 7 7 7 Note in the code above how we’ve used the c() function inside the seq() function. Nesting functions allows us to build quite complex commands within a single line of code and is a very common practice when using R. However, care needs to be taken as too many nested functions can make your code quite difficult for others to understand (or yourself some time in the future!). We could rewrite the code above to explicitly separate the two different steps to generate our vector. Either approach will give the same result, you just need to use your own judgement as to which is more readable. in_vec &lt;- c(3, 1, 10, 7) my_seq7 &lt;- rep(in_vec, each = 3) my_seq7 ## [1] 3 3 3 1 1 1 10 10 10 7 7 7 5.2.2 Knowledge check Use c() to create a vector called weight containing the weight (in lbs) of 10 children: 75, 95, 92, 89, 101, 87, 79, 92, 70, 99. Use the seq() function to create a sequence of numbers ranging from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1. Generate the following sequences. You will need to experiment with the arguments to the rep() function to generate these sequences: 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 “a” “a” “a” “c” “c” “c” “e” “e” “e” “g” “g” “g” “a” “c” “e” “g” “a” “c” “e” “g” “a” “c” “e” “g” 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 5 5.3 Extracting elements To extract (also known as indexing) one or more values (more generally known as elements) from a vector we use the square bracket [ ] notation. The general approach is to name the object you wish to extract from, then a set of square brackets with an index of the element you wish to extract contained within the square brackets. This index can be a position or the result of a logical test. 5.3.1 Positional indexing # extract the 3rd value my_vec[3] ## [1] 1 # if you want to assign this value in another object val_3 &lt;- my_vec[3] val_3 ## [1] 1 Note that the positional index starts at 1 rather than 0 like some other other programming languages (i.e. Python). We can also extract more than one value by using the c() function inside the square brackets. Here we extract the 1st, 5th, 6th and 8th element from the my_vec object my_vec[c(1, 5, 6, 8)] ## [1] 2 4 3 7 Or we can extract a range of values using the : notation. To extract the values from the 3rd to the 8th elements my_vec[3:8] ## [1] 1 6 4 3 3 7 5.3.2 Logical indexing Another really useful way to extract data from a vector is to use a logical expression as an index. For example, to extract all elements with a value greater than 4 in the vector my_vec my_vec[my_vec &gt; 4] ## [1] 6 7 Here, the logical expression is my_vec &gt; 4 and R will only extract those elements that satisfy this logical condition. So how does this actually work? If we look at the output of just the logical expression without the square brackets you can see that R returns a vector containing either TRUE or FALSE which correspond to whether the logical condition is satisfied for each element. In this case only the 4th and 8th elements return a TRUE as their value is greater than 4. my_vec &gt; 4 ## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE So what R is actually doing under the hood is equivalent to my_vec[c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)] ## [1] 6 7 and only those element that are TRUE will be extracted. In addition to the &lt; and &gt; operators you can also use composite operators to increase the complexity of your expressions. For example the expression for ‘greater or equal to’ is &gt;=. To test whether a value is equal to a value we need to use a double equals symbol == and for ‘not equal to’ we use != (the ! symbol means ‘not’). my_vec[my_vec &gt;= 4] # values greater or equal to 4 ## [1] 6 4 7 my_vec[my_vec &lt; 4] # values less than 4 ## [1] 2 3 1 3 3 my_vec[my_vec &lt;= 4] # values less than or equal to 4 ## [1] 2 3 1 4 3 3 my_vec[my_vec == 4] # values equal to 4 ## [1] 4 my_vec[my_vec != 4] # values not equal to 4 ## [1] 2 3 1 6 3 3 7 We can also combine multiple logical expressions using Boolean expressions. In R the &amp; symbol means AND and the | symbol means OR. For example, to extract values in my_vec which are less than 6 AND greater than 2 val26 &lt;- my_vec[my_vec &lt; 6 &amp; my_vec &gt; 2] val26 ## [1] 3 4 3 3 or extract values in my_vec that are greater than 6 OR less than 3 val63 &lt;- my_vec[my_vec &gt; 6 | my_vec &lt; 3] val63 ## [1] 2 1 7 5.3.3 Knowledge check Use c() to create a vector called weight containing the weight (in lbs) of 10 children: 75, 95, 92, 89, 101, 87, 79, 92, 70, 99. Extract the weights for the first and last child. Extract the weights for the first five children. Extract the weights for those children that weigh over 90lbs. 5.4 Replacing elements We can change the values of some elements in a vector using our [ ] notation in combination with the assignment operator &lt;-. For example, to replace the 4th value of our my_vec object from 6 to 500 my_vec[4] &lt;- 500 my_vec ## [1] 2 3 1 500 4 3 3 7 We can also replace more than one value or even replace values based on a logical expression # replace the 6th and 7th element with 100 my_vec[c(6, 7)] &lt;- 100 my_vec ## [1] 2 3 1 500 4 100 100 7 # replace element that are less than or equal to 4 with 1000 my_vec[my_vec &lt;= 4] &lt;- 1000 my_vec ## [1] 1000 1000 1000 500 1000 100 100 7 5.4.1 Knowledge check Use c() to create a vector called weight containing the weight (in lbs) of 10 children: 75, 95, 92, 89, 101, 87, 79, 92, 70, 99. Say we made a mistake and the third child actually weighs 96, change the value for that element. Say the minimum weight allowed to be recorded is 80lbs. Change the value for all elements that are less than 80 to be equal to 80. 5.5 Operations We can use other functions to perform useful operations on vectors. For example, we can calculate the mean, variance, standard deviation and number of elements in our vector by using the mean(), var(), sd() and length() functions mean(my_vec) # returns the mean of my_vec ## [1] 588.38 var(my_vec) # returns the variance of my_vec ## [1] 214367 sd(my_vec) # returns the standard deviation of my_vec ## [1] 463 length(my_vec) # returns the number of elements in my_vec ## [1] 8 If we wanted to use any of these values later on in our analysis we can just assign the resulting value to another object vec_mean &lt;- mean(my_vec) vec_mean ## [1] 588.38 We can also sort values in our element: # ascending order sort(my_vec) ## [1] 7 100 100 500 1000 1000 1000 1000 # decending order sort(my_vec, decreasing = TRUE) ## [1] 1000 1000 1000 1000 500 100 100 7 There are a lot operations that we can perform on vectors. As we progress through this course we’ll see many of these in action. 5.5.1 Knowledge check Use c() to create a vector called weight containing the weight (in lbs) of 10 children: 75, 95, 92, 89, 101, 87, 79, 92, 70, 99. Identify functions that will compute the minimum and maximum values in this vector. What is the mean, median, and standard deviation of child weights? Apply the summary() function on this vector. What does this return? 5.6 Missing data In R, missing data is usually represented by an NA symbol meaning ‘Not Available’. Data may be missing for a whole bunch of reasons, maybe your machine broke down, maybe the weather was too bad to collect data on a particular day, etc. Missing data can be a pain in the proverbial both from an R perspective and also a statistical perspective. From an R perspective missing data can be problematic as different functions deal with missing data in different ways. For example, let’s say we collected air temperature readings over 10 days, but our thermometer broke on day 2 and again on day 9 so we have no data for those days temp &lt;- c(7.2, NA, 7.1, 6.9, 6.5, 5.8, 5.8, 5.5, NA, 5.5) temp ## [1] 7.2 NA 7.1 6.9 6.5 5.8 5.8 5.5 NA 5.5 We now want to calculate the mean temperature over these days using the mean() function mean_temp &lt;- mean(temp) mean_temp ## [1] NA Flippin heck, what’s happened here? Why does the mean() function return an NA? Actually, R is doing something very sensible (at least in our opinion!). If a vector has a missing value then the only possible value to return when calculating a mean is NA. R doesn’t know that you perhaps want to ignore the NA values. Happily, if we look at the help file via help(\"mean\") we can see there is an argument na.rm = which is set to FALSE by default. Most statistical operators will have an na.rm parameter that takes a TRUE or FALSE argument indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the computation proceeds. If we change this argument to na.rm = TRUE when we use the mean() function this will allow us to ignore the NA values when calculating the mean mean_temp &lt;- mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE) mean_temp ## [1] 6.2875 It’s important to note that the NA values have not been removed from our temp object (that would be bad practice), rather the mean() function has just ignored them. The point of the above is to highlight how we can change the default behaviour of a function using an appropriate argument. 5.6.1 Knowledge check Use c() to create a vector called weight containing the weight (in lbs) of 10 children: 75, 95, 92, 89, 101, NA, 79, 92, 70, 99. Compute the min, max, mean, median, and standard deviation of child weights? Apply the summary() function on this vector. How does this differ from before? 5.7 Vectorization 5.7.1 Looping versus Vectorization A key difference between R and many other languages is a topic known as vectorization. What does this mean? It means that many functions that are to be applied individually to each element in a vector of numbers require a loop assessment to evaluate; however, in R many of these functions have been coded in C to perform much faster than a for loop would perform. For example, let’s say you want to add the elements of two separate vectors of numbers (x and y). x &lt;- c(1, 3, 4) y &lt;- c(1, 2, 4) x ## [1] 1 3 4 y ## [1] 1 2 4 In other languages you might have to run a loop to add two vectors together. In this for loop I print each iteration to show that the loop calculates the sum for the first elements in each vector, then performs the sum for the second elements, etc. Don’t worry if you don’t understand each piece of this code. This is just for illustration purposes! You will learn about looping procedures in a later module. # empty vector to store results z &lt;- as.vector(NULL) # `for` loop to add corresponding elements in each vector for (i in seq_along(x)) { z[i] &lt;- x[i] + y[i] print(z) } ## [1] 2 ## [1] 2 5 ## [1] 2 5 8 Instead, in R, + is a vectorized function which can operate on entire vectors at once. So rather than creating for loops for many functions, you can just use simple syntax to perform element-wise operations with both vectors: # add each element in x and y x + y ## [1] 2 5 8 # multiply each element in x and y x * y ## [1] 1 6 16 # compare each element in x to y x &gt; y ## [1] FALSE TRUE FALSE 5.7.2 Recycling When performing vector operations in R, it is important to know about recycling. When performing an operation on two or more vectors of unequal length, R will recycle elements of the shorter vector(s) to match the longest vector. For example: long &lt;- 1:10 short &lt;- 1:5 long ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 short ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 # R will recycle (reuse) the short vector until it reaches # the end of the long vector long + short ## [1] 2 4 6 8 10 7 9 11 13 15 The elements of long and short are added together starting from the first element of both vectors. When R reaches the end of the short vector, it starts again at the first element of short and continues until it reaches the last element of the long vector. This functionality is very useful when you want to perform the same operation on every element of a vector. For example, say we want to multiply every element of our vector long by 3: long &lt;- 1:10 c &lt;- 3 long * c ## [1] 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30 There are no scalars in R, so c is actually a vector of length 1; in order to add its value to every element of long, it is recycled to match the length of long. Don’t get hung up with some of the verbiage used here (i.e. vectors vs. scalars), we will cover what this means in later a module. When the length of the longer object is a multiple of the shorter object length, the recycling occurs silently. When the longer object length is not a multiple of the shorter object length, a warning is given: even_length &lt;- 1:10 odd_length &lt;- 1:3 even_length + odd_length ## Warning in even_length + odd_length: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter ## object length ## [1] 2 4 6 5 7 9 8 10 12 11 5.7.3 Knowledge check Create this vector my_vec &lt;- 1:10. Add 1 to every element in my_vec. Divide every element in my_vec by 2. Create a second vector my_vec2 &lt;- 10:18 and add my_vec to my_vec2. 5.8 Exercises Create a vector called weight containing the weight (in kg) of 10 children: 69, 62, 57, 59, 59, 64, 56, 66, 67, 66. Create a vector called height containing the height (in cm) of the same 10 children: 112, 102, 83, 84, 99, 90, 77, 112, 133, 112. Use the summary() function to summarize these data. Extract the height of the 2nd, 3rd, 9th and 10th child and assign these heights to a variable called some_child. Also extract all the heights of children less than or equal to 99 cm and assign to a variable called shorter_child. Use the information in your weight and height variables to calculate the body mass index (BMI) for each child. The BMI is calculated as weight (in kg) divided by the square of the height (in meters). Store the results of this calculation in a variable called bmi. Note: you don’t need to do this calculation for each child individually, you can leverage vectorization to do this!

Milne If you are not careful your data analyses can become an explosion of data files, R scripts, ggplot graphs, and final reports. Each project evolves and mutates in its own way and keeping all the files associated with a project organized together is a wise practice. In fact, it is such a wise practice that RStudio has built-in support to manage your projects. This built-in capability is called…wait for it…RStudio projects. RStudio projects make it straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents. 8.2.1 Creating Projects RStudio projects are associated with R working directories. You can create an RStudio project: In a new directory In an existing directory where you already have R code and data By cloning a version control (Git or Subversion) repository by selecting File » New Project and then completing the following set-up tasks: 8.2.2 So What’s Different? When a new project is created RStudio: Creates a project file (with an .Rproj extension) within the project directory. This file contains various project options (discussed below) and can also be used as a shortcut for opening the project directly from the filesystem. Creates a hidden directory (named .Rproj.user) where project-specific temporary files (e.g. auto-saved source documents, window-state, etc.) are stored. This directory is also automatically added to .Rbuildignore, .gitignore, etc. if required. Loads the project into RStudio and display its name in the Projects toolbar (which is located on the far right side of the main toolbar) When a project is opened (File » Open Project or by clicking on the .Rproj file directly for the project): A new R session is started The .Rprofile file in the project’s main directory is sourced by R The .RData file in the project’s main directory is loaded (if any) The history for the project is loaded into the History panel The working directory is set to the project’s directory. Previously edited source documents are restored into editor tabs Other RStudio settings are restored to where they were the last time the project was closed As you write and execute code in the project all updates and outputs created will be saved to the project directory. And when you close out of the project the .RData and .Rhistory files will be saved (if these options are selected in the global options) and the list of open source documents are saved so that they can be restored the next time you open the project. There are additional project options you can choose from to customize the project at Tools » Project Options. These project options are overrides for existing global options. To inherit the default global behavior for a project you can specify (Default) as the option value. 8.2.3 Knowledge check Go ahead and create an R Project for this class. Make sure the following RStudio preference settings are set: General: Set “Save workspace to .RData on exit: Never”. Code: In the display tab check the “Show margin” option and set “Margin Column: 80”. Code &gt;&gt; Diagnostics: Make sure the “Provide R style diagnostics” is checked. 8.3 R Markdown R Markdown provides an easy way to produce a rich, fully-documented reproducible analysis. It allows the user to share a single file that contains all of the prose, code, and metadata needed to reproduce the analysis from beginning to end. R Markdown allows for “chunks” of R code to be included along with Markdown text to produce a nicely formatted HTML, PDF, or Word file without having to know any HTML or LaTeX code or have to fuss with difficult formatting issues. One R Markdown file can generate a variety of different formats and all of this is done in a single text file with a few bits of formatting. So how does it work? Creating documents with R Markdown starts with an .Rmd file that contains a combination of text and R code chunks. The .Rmd file is fed to knitr, which executes all of the R code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document with the output. Pandoc then processes the .md file to create a finished report in the form of a web page, PDF, Word document, slide show, etc. Sounds confusing you say, don’t fret. Much of what takes place happens behind the scenes. You primarily need to worry only about the syntax required in the .Rmd file. You then press a button and out comes your report. 8.3.1 Creating an R Markdown File To create an R Markdown file you can select File » New File » R Markdown or you can select the shortcut for creating a new document in the top left-hand corner of the RStudio window. You will be given an option to create an HTML, PDF, or Word document; however, R Markdown let’s you change seamlessly between these options after you’ve created your document so I tend to just select the default HTML option. There are additional options such as creating Presentations (HTML or PDF), Shiny documents, or other template documents but for now we will focus on the initial HTML, PDF, or Word document options. 8.3.2 Components of an R Markdown File There are three general components of an R Markdown file that you will eventually become accustomed to. This includes the YAML, the general markdown (or text) component, and code chunks. 8.3.2.1 YAML Header The first few lines you see in the R Markdown report are known as the YAML. --- title: &quot;R Markdown Demo&quot; author: &quot;Brad Boehmke&quot; date: &quot;2016-08-15&quot; output: html_document --- These lines will generate a generic heading at the top of the final report. There are several YAML options to enhance your reports such as the following: You can include hyperlinks around the title or author name: --- title: &quot;R Markdown Demo&quot; author: &quot;[Brad Boehmke](http://bradleyboehmke.github.io)&quot; date: &quot;2016-08-15&quot; output: html_document --- If you don’t want the date to be hard-coded you can include R code so that anytime you re-run the report the current date will print off at the top. You can also exclude the date (or author and title information) by including NULL or simply by deleting that line: --- title: &quot;R Markdown Demo&quot; author: &quot;[Brad Boehmke](http://bradleyboehmke.github.io)&quot; date: &quot;2022-05-06&quot; output: html_document --- By default, your report will not include a table of contents (TOC). However, you can easily generate one by including the toc: true argument. There are several TOC options such as the level of headers to include in the TOC, whether to have a fixed or floating TOC, to have a collapsable TOC, etc. You can find many of the TOC options here. --- title: &quot;R Markdown Demo&quot; author: &quot;[Brad Boehmke](http://bradleyboehmke.github.io)&quot; date: &quot;2022-05-06&quot; output: html_document: toc: true toc_float: true --- When knitr processes an R Markdown input file it creates a markdown (.md) file which is subsequently transformed into HTML by pandoc. If you want to keep a copy of the markdown file after rendering you can do so using the keep_md: true option. This will likely not be a concern at first but when (if) you start doing a lot of online writing you will find that keeping the .md file is extremely beneficial. --- title: &quot;R Markdown Demo&quot; author: &quot;[Brad Boehmke](http://bradleyboehmke.github.io)&quot; date: &quot;2022-05-06&quot; output: html_document: keep_md: true --- There are many YAML options which you can read more about at: HTML reports: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html PDF (LaTex) reports: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html Word reports: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/word_document_format.html 8.3.2.2 Text Formatting The beauty of R Markdown is the ability to easily combine prose (text) and code. For the text component, much of your writing is similar to when you type a Word document; however, to perform many of the basic text formatting you use basic markdown code such as: There are many additional formatting options which can be viewed here and here; however, this should get you well on your way. 8.3.2.3 Code Chunks R code chunks can be used as a means to render R output into documents or to simply display code for illustration. Code chunks start with the following line: {r chunk_name}&lt;/code&gt; and end with &lt;code&gt;. You can quickly insert chunks into your R Markdown file with the keyboard shortcut Cmd + Option + I (Windows Ctrl + Alt + I). Here is a simple R code chunk that will result in both the code and it’s output being included: ```{r} head(iris) ``` Chunk output can be customized with many knitr options which are arguments set in the {} of a chunk header. Examples include: 1. echo=FALSE hides the code but displays results: ```{r echo=FALSE} x &lt;- rnorm(100) y &lt;- 2 * x + rnorm(100) cor(x, y) ``` 2. results='hide' hides the results but shows the code ```{r results=&#39;hide&#39;} x &lt;- rnorm(100) y &lt;- 2 * x + rnorm(100) cor(x, y) ``` 3. eval=FALSE displays the code but does not evaluate it ```{r eval=FALSE} x &lt;- rnorm(100) y &lt;- 2 * x + rnorm(100) cor(x, y) ``` 4. include=FALSE evaluates the code but does not display code or output ```{r include=FALSE} x &lt;- rnorm(100) y &lt;- 2 * x + rnorm(100) cor(x, y) ``` 5. warning=FALSE and message=FALSE are useful for suppressing any messages produced when loading packages ```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE} library(dplyr) ``` 6. collapse=TRUE will collapse your output to be contained within the code chunk ```{r, collapse=TRUE} head(iris) ``` 7. fig... options are available to align and size figure outputs ```{r, fig.align=&#39;center&#39;, fig.height=3, fig.width=4} library(ggplot2) ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) + geom_point() ``` 8.3.2.4 Inline code chunks A key motivation for reproducible research is to link any results reported directly to the data and functions used to create them. Consequently, you should never manual insert numbers such as “The average miles per gallon is 20.1.” Rather, code results can be inserted directly into the text of a .Rmd file by enclosing the code with `r ` such as: “The average miles per gallon is `r mean(mtcars$mpg)`.” Now if the underlying data changes you do not need to remember all the inline values you manually entered. You may not like the fact that the output is reporting all the decimals. You could include the round function in the inline code: `r round(mean(mtcars$mpg), 1)`. 8.3.2.5 Dealing with Tables By default, the table outputs produced in R Markdown will look like the output you would see in your console. However, if you prefer that data be displayed with additional formatting you can use the knitr::kable() function. For example: ```{r, results=&#39;asis&#39;} knitr::kable(iris) ``` To include captions: ```{r} knitr::kable(head(iris), caption = &#39;Example caption for the iris data frame&#39;) ``` The simplest approach to print nice looking tables is to use the printr package which can be installed from CRAN. ```{r} library(printr) head(iris) ``` There are several packages that can be used to make very nice tables: printr xtable stargazer tables pander 8.3.3 Knitting the R Markdown File When you are all done writing your .Rmd document you have two options to render the output. The first is to call the following function in your console: render(\"document_name.Rmd\", output_format = \"html_document\"). Alternatively you can click the drop down arrow next to the knit button on the RStudio toolbar, select the document format (HTML, PDF, Word) and your report will be developed. The following output formats are available to use with R Markdown. Documents: html_notebook - Interactive R Notebooks html_document - HTML document w/ Bootstrap CSS pdf_document - PDF document (via LaTeX template) word_document - Microsoft Word document (docx) odt_document - OpenDocument Text document rtf_document - Rich Text Format document md_document - Markdown document (various flavors) Presentations (slides): ioslides_presentation - HTML presentation with ioslides revealjs::revealjs_presentation - HTML presentation with reveal.js slidy_presentation - HTML presentation with W3C Slidy beamer_presentation - PDF presentation with LaTeX Beamer More: flexdashboard::flex_dashboard - Interactive dashboards tufte::tufte_handout - PDF handouts in the style of Edward Tufte tufte::tufte_html - HTML handouts in the style of Edward Tufte tufte::tufte_book - PDF books in the style of Edward Tufte html_vignette - R package vignette (HTML) github_document - GitHub Flavored Markdown document bookdown - Write HTML, PDF, ePub, and Kindle books with R Markdown 8.3.4 Additional Resources R Markdown is an incredible tool for reproducible research and there are a lot of resources available. Here are just a few of the available resources to learn more about R Markdown. Rstudio tutorials R Markdown course by DataCamp Karl Browman’s tutorial Daring Fireball Reproducible Research course on Coursera Chester Ismay’s book Also, you can find the R Markdown cheatsheet within the RStudio console at Help menu » Cheatsheets. 8.3.5 Knowledge check Create a new R Markdown document with File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown… Knit it by clicking the appropriate button. Knit it by using the appropriate keyboard short cut. Verify that you can modify the input and see the output update. Practice what you’ve learned by creating a brief CV. The title should be your name, and you should include headings for (at least) education or employment. Each of the sections should include a bulleted list of jobs/degrees. Highlight the year in bold. Using the R Markdown quick reference, figure out how to: Add a footnote. Add a horizontal rule. Add a block quote. 8.4 R Notebooks An R Notebook is an R Markdown document that allows for independent and interactive execution of the code chunks. This allows you to visually assess the output as you develop your R Markdown document without having to knit the entire document to see the output. R Notebooks can be thought of as a unique execution mode for R Markdown documents as any R Markdown document can be used as a notebook, and all R Notebooks can be rendered to other R Markdown document types. The interactive capabilities of the notebook mode makes it extremely useful for writing R Markdown documents and iterating on code. 8.4.1 Creating an R Notebook Creating an R Notebook is similar to creating an R Markdown document - you’ll notice a new option for creating an R Notebook. When you create a new R Notebook the primary differece you will notice at first is the YAML which will look like: --- title: &quot;R Notebook&quot; output: html_notebook --- The default notebook mode allows inline output on all R Markdown documents. If you prefer to use the traditional console method of interaction, you can disable notebook mode by clicking the gear in the editor toolbar and choosing Chunk Output in Console. You can also toggle between previewing the document in the Viewer Pane versus in a Window. 8.4.2 Interactiveness of an R Notebook Writing an R Notebook document is no different than writing an R Markdown document. The text and code chunk syntax does not differ from what you learned in the previous section of this lesson. The primary difference is in the interactiveness of an R Notebook. Primarily that when executing chunks in an R Markdown document, all the code is sent to the console at once, but in an R Notebook, only one line at a time is sent. This allows execution to stop if a line raises an error. There are couple options for executing code chunks. You can execute code chunks individually by: Having the cursor within the code chunk and selecting ⌘ + enter Clicking the Run Current Chunk button in the first line (far right-hand side) of the code chunk Or selecting the Run Current Chunk option from the Run menu in the RStudio console toolbar You can also run all chunks in your document by: Selecting the Run All option from the Run menu in the RStudio console toolbar Using the keyboard shortcut ⌥ + ⌘ + R When a code chunk is waiting to be executed, you’ll notice a progress meter that appears to the left of the code chunk plus there will be a status in the editor’s status bar indicating the number of chunks remaining to be executed. You can click on this meter at any time to jump to the currently executing chunk. 8.4.3 Saving, Sharing, Previewing &amp; Knitting an R Notebook When a notebook .Rmd is saved, an .nb.html file is created alongside it. This file is a self-contained HTML file which contains all current code chunks (collapsable/expandable) and their respective outputs. You can view this .nb.html file directly in any browser along with sharing it with others who can also view it in any browser. Ordinary R Markdown documents are “knit”, but notebooks are “previewed”. So by default, when you select the preview option in the editor toolbar your document will be previewed in the Viewer Pane. You can preview your document in a window by selecting the desired option in the gear in the editor toolbar. When you are ready to publish the document, you can share the .nb.html directly, or render it to a publication format by knitting the document to the desired format. 8.4.4 Additional Resources Learn more about R Notebook at RStudio’s tutorial page. 8.4.5 Knowledge check Create a new notebook using File &gt; New File &gt; R Notebook. Read the instructions. Practice running the chunks. Verify that you can modify the code, re-run it, and see modified output. Compare and contrast the R notebook you just created with the R markdown file you created in the previous knowledge check. How are the outputs similar? How are they different? How are the inputs similar? How are they different? What happens if you copy the YAML header from one to the other? 8.5 Exercises If you have not already done so create an R project for this course so that all future scripts, inputs, and outputs are organized. Make sure the following RStudio preference settings are set: General: Set “Save workspace to .RData on exit: Never”. Code: In the display tab check the “Show margin” option and set “Margin Column: 80”. Code &gt;&gt; Diagnostics: Make sure the “Provide R style diagnostics” is checked. Create a new R Markdown document and include code and text from some of the activities we covered in lesson 3 of module 1. Now knit this document using each of the three built-in formats: HTML, PDF and Word. How does the output differ? You may need to install LaTeX in order to build the PDF output — RStudio will prompt you if this is necessary. "],["lesson-2b-data-types-structures.html", "9 Lesson 2b: Data types &amp; structures 9.1 Learning objectives 9.2 Data types 9.3 Data structures 9.4 Exercises", " 9 Lesson 2b: Data types &amp; structures Until now, you’ve created fairly simple data in R and stored it as a vector! However, when wrangling data we often come across a variety of data types and require different data structures to manage them. This lesson serves to introduce you to the basic data types and structures in R that you’ll most commonly use. 9.1 Learning objectives Upon completing this module you will be able to: Explain the benefits of an R project and new ones. Explain the similarities and differences between R Markdown files and R Notebooks. Create both R Markdown and R Notebook deliverables. 9.2 Data types R has six basic types of data: numeric, integer, logical, character, complex and raw. However, it is very unlikely that in your time as a data analyst/scientist you’ll need to work with complex and raw data types so we’ll focus on the first four. Numeric data are numbers that contain a decimal. Actually they can also be whole numbers but we’ll gloss over that. Integers are whole numbers (those numbers without a decimal point). Logical data take on the value of either TRUE or FALSE. There’s also another special type of logical called NA to represent missing values. Character data are used to represent string values. You can think of character strings as something like a word (or multiple words). A special type of character string is a factor, which is a string but with additional attributes (like levels or an order). We’ll cover factors later. 9.2.1 Determining the type R is (usually) able to automatically distinguish between different classes of data by their nature and the context in which they’re used although you should bear in mind that R can’t actually read your mind and you may have to explicitly tell R how you want to treat a data type. You can find out the type (or class) of any object using the class() function. num &lt;- 2.2 class(num) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; char &lt;- &quot;hello world&quot; class(char) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; logi &lt;- TRUE class(logi) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; Alternatively, you can ask if an object is a specific class using a logical test. The is.xxxx() family of functions will return either a TRUE or a FALSE. is.numeric(num) ## [1] TRUE is.character(num) ## [1] FALSE is.character(char) ## [1] TRUE is.logical(logi) ## [1] TRUE 9.2.2 Type conversion It can sometimes be useful to be able to change the class of a variable using the as.xxxx() family of coercion functions, although you need to be careful when doing this as you might receive some unexpected results (see what happens below when we try to convert a character string to a numeric). # coerce numeric to character class(num) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; num_char &lt;- as.character(num) num_char ## [1] &quot;2.2&quot; class(num_char) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; # coerce character to numeric! class(char) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; char_num &lt;- as.numeric(char) ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion Type Logical test Coercing Character is.character as.character Numeric is.numeric as.numeric Logical is.logical as.logical Factor is.factor as.factor Complex is.complex as.complex In later modules we will learn how to wrangle these different data types plus other special data types that are built on top of these classes (i.e. date-time stamps, missing values). For now, I just want you to understand the foundational data types built into R. 9.2.3 Knowledge check Check out the built-in object pi. What class is this object? What happens when you coerce this object to a character? What happens when you coerce it to a logical? Is there a coercion function that could convert this to an integer? What happens when you do this? 9.3 Data structures Now that you’ve been introduced to some of the most important classes of data in R, let’s have a look at some of main structures that we have for storing these data. 9.3.1 Scalars and vectors Perhaps the simplest type of data structure is the vector. You’ve already been introduced to vectors in module 1. Vectors that have a single value (length 1) are often referred to as scalars. Vectors can contain numbers, characters, factors or logicals, but the key thing to remember is that all the elements inside a vector must be of the same class. In other words, vectors can contain either numbers, characters or logicals but not mixtures of these types of data. There is one important exception to this, you can include NA (this is special type of logical) to denote missing data in vectors with other data types. All the elements inside a vector must be of the same class 9.3.2 Matrices and arrays Another useful data structure used in many disciplines such as population ecology, theoretical and applied statistics is the matrix. A matrix is simply a vector that has additional attributes called dimensions. Arrays are just multidimensional matrices. Again, matrices and arrays must contain elements all of the same data class. 9.3.2.1 Creating A convenient way to create a matrix or an array is to use the matrix() and array() functions respectively. Below, we will create a matrix from a sequence 1 to 16 in four rows (nrow = 4) and fill the matrix row-wise (byrow = TRUE) rather than the default column-wise. When using the array() function we define the dimensions using the dim = argument, in our case 2 rows, 4 columns in 2 different matrices. my_mat &lt;- matrix(1:16, nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE) my_mat ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 2 3 4 ## [2,] 5 6 7 8 ## [3,] 9 10 11 12 ## [4,] 13 14 15 16 my_array &lt;- array(1:16, dim = c(2, 4, 2)) my_array ## , , 1 ## ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 1 3 5 7 ## [2,] 2 4 6 8 ## ## , , 2 ## ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] ## [1,] 9 11 13 15 ## [2,] 10 12 14 16 Sometimes it’s also useful to define row and column names for your matrix but this is not a requirement. To do this use the rownames() and colnames() functions. rownames(my_mat) &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;) colnames(my_mat) &lt;- c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) my_mat ## a b c d ## A 1 2 3 4 ## B 5 6 7 8 ## C 9 10 11 12 ## D 13 14 15 16 9.3.2.2 Indexing Similar to vectors, we can extract elements from our matrix using [] notation. The main difference is we now have to specify two dimensions in our indexing matrix[row, col]: # element located at the intersection of the # third row and second column my_mat[3, 2] ## [1] 10 We can also leave one dimension empty if we want to retrieve all elements for that particular dimension. # all elements in the second row my_mat[2, ] ## a b c d ## 5 6 7 8 # all elements in the third column my_mat[, 3] ## A B C D ## 3 7 11 15 And when rows and columns are named we can also index based on those names: # Element located in row &#39;A&#39; and column &#39;b&#39; my_mat[&#39;A&#39;, &#39;b&#39;] ## [1] 2 9.3.2.3 Operators Once you’ve created your matrices you can do useful stuff with them and as you’d expect. Many of the functions we used in the vector lesson can be applied across an entire matrix: # mean of all elements mean(my_mat) ## [1] 8.5 However, there are also unique functions that work on matrices but not vectors. For example, we can compute the mean of each column in a matrix: colMeans(my_mat) ## a b c d ## 7 8 9 10 R has numerous built in functions to perform matrix operations. Some of the most common are given below. For example, to transpose a matrix we use the transposition function t(): my_mat_t &lt;- t(my_mat) my_mat_t ## A B C D ## a 1 5 9 13 ## b 2 6 10 14 ## c 3 7 11 15 ## d 4 8 12 16 To extract the diagonal elements of a matrix and store them as a vector we can use the diag() function: my_mat_diag &lt;- diag(my_mat) my_mat_diag ## [1] 1 6 11 16 The usual matrix addition, multiplication etc can be performed. Note the use of the %*% operator to perform matrix multiplication. mat.1 &lt;- matrix(c(2, 0, 1, 1), nrow = 2) mat.1 ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 2 1 ## [2,] 0 1 mat.2 &lt;- matrix(c(1, 1, 0, 2), nrow = 2) mat.2 ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 0 ## [2,] 1 2 mat.1 + mat.2 # matrix addition ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 3 1 ## [2,] 1 3 mat.1 * mat.2 # element by element products ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 2 0 ## [2,] 0 2 mat.1 %*% mat.2 # matrix multiplication ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 3 2 ## [2,] 1 2 9.3.2.4 Knowledge check Check out the built-in VADeaths data matrix? Subset this matrix for only male death rates. Subset for males death rates over the age of 60. Calculate averages for each column and row. 9.3.3 Lists The next data structure we will quickly take a look at is a list. Whilst vectors and matrices are constrained to contain data of the same type, lists are able to store mixtures of data types. In fact we can even store other data structures such as vectors and arrays within a list or even have a list of a list. Lists a very flexible data structures which is ideal for storing irregular or non-rectangular data. Many statistical outputs are provided as a list as well; therefore, its critical to understand how to work with lists. 9.3.3.1 Creating To create a list we can use the list() function. Note how each of the three list elements are of different classes (character, logical, and numeric) and are of different lengths. list_1 &lt;- list(c(&quot;black&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;), c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE), matrix(1:6, nrow = 3)) list_1 ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;black&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; &quot;orange&quot; ## ## [[2]] ## [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE ## ## [[3]] ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 4 ## [2,] 2 5 ## [3,] 3 6 Elements of the list can be named during the construction of the list list_2 &lt;- list(colours = c(&quot;black&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;), evaluation = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE), time = matrix(1:6, nrow = 3)) list_2 ## $colours ## [1] &quot;black&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; &quot;orange&quot; ## ## $evaluation ## [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE ## ## $time ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 4 ## [2,] 2 5 ## [3,] 3 6 or after the list has been created using the names() function names(list_1) &lt;- c(&quot;colors&quot;, &quot;evaluation&quot;, &quot;time&quot;) list_1 ## $colors ## [1] &quot;black&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; &quot;orange&quot; ## ## $evaluation ## [1] TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE ## ## $time ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 4 ## [2,] 2 5 ## [3,] 3 6 We can always get a quick glimpse of the structure of a list using str(): str(list_1) ## List of 3 ## $ colors : chr [1:3] &quot;black&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; &quot;orange&quot; ## $ evaluation: logi [1:6] TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE ## $ time : int [1:3, 1:2] 1 2 3 4 5 6 9.3.3.2 Indexing To subset lists we can utilize the single bracket [ ], double brackets [[ ]], and dollar sign $ operators. Each approach provides a specific purpose and can be combined in different ways to achieve the following subsetting objectives: Subset list and preserve output as a list Subset list and simplify output Subset list to get elements out of a list To extract one or more list items while preserving the output in list format use the [ ] operator. Its important to understand the difference between simplifying and preserving subsetting. Simplifying subsets returns the simplest possible data structure that can represent the output. Preserving subsets keeps the structure of the output the same as the input. See Hadley Wickham’s section on Simplifying vs. Preserving Subsetting to learn more. # extract first list item list_1[1] ## $colors ## [1] &quot;black&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; &quot;orange&quot; # same as above but using the item&#39;s name list_1[&#39;colors&#39;] ## $colors ## [1] &quot;black&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; &quot;orange&quot; # extract multiple list items list_1[c(&#39;colors&#39;, &#39;time&#39;)] ## $colors ## [1] &quot;black&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; &quot;orange&quot; ## ## $time ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 4 ## [2,] 2 5 ## [3,] 3 6 To extract one or more list items while simplifying the output use the [[ ]] or $ operator: # extract first list item list_1[[1]] ## [1] &quot;black&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; &quot;orange&quot; # same as above but using the item&#39;s name list_1[[&#39;colors&#39;]] ## [1] &quot;black&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; &quot;orange&quot; # same as above but using $ list_1$colors ## [1] &quot;black&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; &quot;orange&quot; One thing that differentiates the [[ operator from the \\(&lt;/code&gt; is that the &lt;code&gt;[[&lt;/code&gt; operator can be used with computed indices. The &lt;code&gt;\\) operator can only be used with literal names. To extract individual elements out of a specific list item combine the [[ (or $) operator with the [ operator: # extract the third element of the first list item list_1[[&#39;colors&#39;]][3] ## [1] &quot;orange&quot; 9.3.3.3 Operators There are less operators that you typically use directly on a list. Most of the time you are trying to extract items out of a list. However, a few useful functions that are applied to a list include: # how many items are in a list length(list_1) ## [1] 3 # the name of the list items names(list_1) ## [1] &quot;colors&quot; &quot;evaluation&quot; &quot;time&quot; # the overall structure of a list str(list_1) ## List of 3 ## $ colors : chr [1:3] &quot;black&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; &quot;orange&quot; ## $ evaluation: logi [1:6] TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE FALSE FALSE ## $ time : int [1:3, 1:2] 1 2 3 4 5 6 9.3.3.4 Knowledge check Install and load the nycflights13 package: install.packages(&#39;nycflights13&#39;) Using the flights data provided by this package create the following regression model: This line of code is performing a linear regression model and saving the results in a list called flight_lm. We’ll discuss linear regression and modeling in later modules. flight_lm &lt;- lm(arr_delay ~ dep_delay + month + carrier, data = flights) How many items are in this list? What are the names of these list items? Extract the coefficients of this model. Extract the departure delay (dep_delay) coefficient. 9.3.4 Data frames By far the most commonly used data structure to store data is the data frame. A data frame is a powerful two-dimensional object made up of rows and columns which looks superficially very similar to a matrix. However, whilst matrices are restricted to containing data all of the same type, data frames can contain a mixture of different types of data. Typically, in a data frame each row corresponds to an individual observation and each column corresponds to a different measured or recorded variable. This setup may be familiar to those of you who use Microsoft Excel to manage and store your data. Perhaps a useful way to think about data frames is that they are essentially made up of a bunch of vectors (columns) with each vector containing its own data type but the data type can be different between vectors. As an example, the data frame below contains total quantity and sales for a grocery product category (i.e. potatoes, popcorn, frozen pizza) for each household. The data frame has four variables (columns) and each row represents an individual household. The variables household_id, total_quantity, and total_sales are numeric, product_category is a character, and multiple_items is a Boolean representing if the household bought more than one item. household_id product_category total_quantity total_sales multiple_items 110 CARROTS 1 1.38 FALSE 1160 FROZEN PIZZA 3 3.00 TRUE 1197 FLUID MILK PRODUCTS 1 2.59 FALSE 1565 MEAT - SHELF STABLE 1 1.59 FALSE 1752 CHEESE 4 8.66 TRUE 1845 BABY HBC 2 11.17 TRUE 1879 TOMATOES 2 6.28 TRUE 2011 SOFT DRINKS 8 8.28 TRUE 2050 CONVENIENT BRKFST/WHLSM SNACKS 1 1.67 FALSE 210 BAKED BREAD/BUNS/ROLLS 3 2.65 TRUE 2142 SOFT DRINKS 1 3.99 FALSE 2281 SPICES &amp; EXTRACTS 2 5.90 TRUE 2309 BREAD 3 3.00 TRUE 2340 ONIONS 3 1.88 TRUE 2496 NA 0 0.00 FALSE 571 SHORTENING/OIL 1 7.99 FALSE 578 CORN 3 1.00 TRUE 708 FLUID MILK PRODUCTS 1 1.99 FALSE 888 BAKING MIXES 1 0.92 FALSE 983 DRY BN/VEG/POTATO/RICE 2 1.98 TRUE There are a couple of important things to bear in mind about data frames. These types of objects are known as rectangular data as each column must have the same number of observations. Also, any missing data should be recorded as an NA just as we did with our vectors. 9.3.4.1 Creating Data frames are usually created by reading in a data set, which we’ll cover in a later lesson. However, data frames can also be created explicitly with the data.frame() function or they can be coerced from other types of objects like lists. In this case I’ll create a simple data frame df and assess its basic structure: df &lt;- data.frame(col1 = 1:3, col2 = c(&quot;this&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;text&quot;), col3 = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), col4 = c(2.5, 4.2, pi)) # assess the structure of a data frame str(df) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 3 obs. of 4 variables: ## $ col1: int 1 2 3 ## $ col2: chr &quot;this&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;text&quot; ## $ col3: logi TRUE FALSE TRUE ## $ col4: num 2.5 4.2 3.14 # number of rows nrow(df) ## [1] 3 # number of columns ncol(df) ## [1] 4 Note how col2 in df was converted to a column of factors. This is because there is a default setting in data.frame() that converts character columns to factors. We can turn this off by setting the stringsAsFactors = FALSE argument: df &lt;- data.frame(col1 = 1:3, col2 = c(&quot;this&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;text&quot;), col3 = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE), col4 = c(2.5, 4.2, pi), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) # note how col2 now is of a character class str(df) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 3 obs. of 4 variables: ## $ col1: int 1 2 3 ## $ col2: chr &quot;this&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;text&quot; ## $ col3: logi TRUE FALSE TRUE ## $ col4: num 2.5 4.2 3.14 We can also convert pre-existing structures to a data frame. The following illustrates how we can turn multiple vectors into a data frame: v1 &lt;- 1:3 v2 &lt;-c(&quot;this&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;text&quot;) v3 &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) # convert same length vectors to a data frame using data.frame() data.frame(col1 = v1, col2 = v2, col3 = v3) ## col1 col2 col3 ## 1 1 this TRUE ## 2 2 is FALSE ## 3 3 text TRUE 9.3.4.2 Indexing Data frames possess the characteristics of both lists and matrices: if you index with a single vector, they behave like lists and will return the selected columns with all rows; if you subset with two vectors, they behave like matrices and can be subset by row and column: df ## col1 col2 col3 col4 ## 1 1 this TRUE 2.5000 ## 2 2 is FALSE 4.2000 ## 3 3 text TRUE 3.1416 # subsetting by row numbers df[2:3, ] ## col1 col2 col3 col4 ## 2 2 is FALSE 4.2000 ## 3 3 text TRUE 3.1416 # subsetting by row names df[c(&quot;row2&quot;, &quot;row3&quot;), ] ## col1 col2 col3 col4 ## NA NA &lt;NA&gt; NA NA ## NA.1 NA &lt;NA&gt; NA NA # subset for both rows and columns df[1:2, c(1, 3)] ## col1 col3 ## 1 1 TRUE ## 2 2 FALSE You can also subset data frames based on conditional statements. To illustrate we’ll use the built-in mtcars data frame: head(mtcars) ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 # all rows where mpg is greater than 20 mtcars[mtcars$mpg &gt; 20, ] ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108.0 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 ## Merc 240D 24.4 4 146.7 62 3.69 3.190 20.00 1 0 4 2 ## Merc 230 22.8 4 140.8 95 3.92 3.150 22.90 1 0 4 2 ## Fiat 128 32.4 4 78.7 66 4.08 2.200 19.47 1 1 4 1 ## Honda Civic 30.4 4 75.7 52 4.93 1.615 18.52 1 1 4 2 ## Toyota Corolla 33.9 4 71.1 65 4.22 1.835 19.90 1 1 4 1 ## Toyota Corona 21.5 4 120.1 97 3.70 2.465 20.01 1 0 3 1 ## Fiat X1-9 27.3 4 79.0 66 4.08 1.935 18.90 1 1 4 1 ## Porsche 914-2 26.0 4 120.3 91 4.43 2.140 16.70 0 1 5 2 ## Lotus Europa 30.4 4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90 1 1 5 2 ## Volvo 142E 21.4 4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60 1 1 4 2 Its good to know that we can index and filter data frames in this fashion but later lessons will demonstrate an alternative, and more common approach to wrangle data frames. In fact, most of the lessons that follow are all focused on working with data frames! 9.4 Exercises Check out the built-in mtcars data set. What type of object is this? Apply the head() and summary() functions to mtcars, what do these functions return? Index for just the ‘mpg’ column in mtcars using three different approaches: single brackets ([), double brackets [[, and dollar sign $. How do the results differ? Use one of the methods in #3 to save the ‘mpg’ column as a vector. Now compute the mean of this vector.

Typically you have many tables of data, and you must combine them to answer the questions that you’re interested in. Collectively, multiple tables of data are called relational data because it is the relations, not just the individual datasets, that are important. Moreover, as data scientists work across multiple datasets they often find themselves working with different data types (i.e. numeric, categorical, date-times) and this can present many challenges. In this module we’ll explore how to use different join operations when working with relational data along with introduce additional Tidyverse packages that will simplify working with different data types. 15.1 Learning objectives By the end of this module you should be able to: Describe and apply the different join operations.

Formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer, the DRY principle states that “every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.” This principle has been widely adopted to imply that you should not duplicate code. Although the principle was meant to be far grander than that, there’s plenty of merit behind this slight misinterpretation. Removing duplication is an important part of writing efficient code and reducing potential errors. First, reduced duplication of code can improve computing time and reduces the amount of code writing required. Second, less duplication results in less creating and saving of unnecessary objects. Inefficient code invariably creates copies of objects you have little interest in other than to feed into some future line of code; this wrecks havoc on properly managing your objects as it basically results in a global environment charlie foxtrot! Less duplication also results in less editing. When changes to code are required, duplicated code becomes tedious to edit and invariably mistakes or fat-fingering occur in the cut-and-paste editing process which just lengthens the editing that much more. Thus, minimizing duplication by writing efficient code is important to becoming a data analyst and in this module you learn to improve your code efficiency with control flow, iteration, and functions. 23.1 Learning objectives By the end of this module you should be able to: Use a variety of control statements to control the flow of code evaluation.
