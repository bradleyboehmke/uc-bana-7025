The following is a truncated syllabus; for the full syllabus along with complete course content please visit the online course content in Canvas. Welcome to Data Wrangling with R! This course provides an intensive, hands-on introduction to Data Wrangling with the R programming language. You will learn the fundamental skills required to acquire, munge, transform, manipulate, and visualize data in a computing environment that fosters reproducibility. Data wrangling, which is also commonly referred to as data munging, transformation, manipulation, janitor work, etc. can be a painstakingly laborious process. In fact, it has been stated that up to 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing data (Wickham 2014; Dasu and Johnson 2003). However, being a prerequisite to the rest of the data analysis workflow (visualization, modeling, reporting), it’s essential that you become fluent and efficient in data wrangling techniques. Learning Objectives This course will guide you through the data wrangling process along with give you a solid foundation of the basics of working with data in R. My goal is to teach you how to easily wrangle your data so you can spend more time focused on understanding the content of your data via visualization, modeling, and reporting your results. Upon successfully completing this course, you will be able to: Perform your data analysis in a literate programming environment Manage different types of data Manage different data structures Import and export data Index, subset, reshape and transform your data Compute descriptive statistics Visualize data Make your code efficient by using control statements &amp; iteration Write your own functions …all with R! This course assumes no prior knowledge of R. Experience with programming concepts or another programming language will help, but is not required to understand the material. Material The bulk of the classroom material will be provided via this book, the recorded lectures, and class notes. In some cases there are additional recommended readings, all of which are readily available online. Class Structure Modules: For this class each module is covered over the course of week. In the “Overview” section for each module you will find overall learning objectives, a short description of the learning content covered in that module, along with all tasks that are required of you for that module (i.e. quizzes, lab). Each module will have two or more primary lessons and associated quizzes along with a lab. Lessons: For each lesson you will read and work through the tutorial. Short videos will be sprinkled throughout the lesson to further discuss and reinforce lesson concepts. Each lesson will have various “Your Turn” exercises throughout, along with end-of-lesson exercises. I highly recommend you work through these exercises as they will prepare you for the quizzes, labs, and project work. Quizzes: There will be a short quiz associated with each lesson. These quizzes will be hosted in the course website on Canvas. Please check Canvas for due dates for these quizzes. Labs: There will be a lab associated with each module. For these labs students will be guided through a case study step-by-step. The aim is to provide a detailed view on how to manage a variety of complex real-world data; how to convert real problems into data wrangling and analysis problems; and to apply R to address these problems and extract insights from the data. Submission of these labs will be done through the course website on Canvas. Please check Canvas for due dates for these labs. Project: TBD Schedule See the Canvas course webpage for a detailed schedule with due dates for quizzes, labs, etc. Module Description 1 Introduction Intro to data wrangling, R, and this course R fundamentals &amp; the Rstudio IDE 2 Reproducible Documents and Importing Data Managing your workflow and reproducibility Importing data and understanding the basics of it 3 Tidy Data and Data Manipulation Tidying &amp; preparing data for analysis Data manipulation 4 Relational Data and More Tidyverse Packages Relational data Leveraging the Tidyverse to simplify data wrangling 5 Data Visualization &amp; Exploration Data visualization Exploratory data analysis 6 Creating Efficient Code in R Control statements &amp; iteration Writing functions 7 Introduction to Applied Modeling Correlation &amp; pattern discovery Introduction to machine learning Conventions used in this book The following typographical conventions are used in this book: strong italic: indicates new terms, bold: indicates package &amp; file names, inline code: monospaced highlighted text indicates functions or other commands that could be typed literally by the user, code chunk: indicates commands or other text that could be typed literally by the user 1 + 2 ## [1] 3 In addition to the general text used throughout, you will notice the following code chunks with images: Signifies a tip or suggestion Signifies a general note Signifies a warning or caution Feedback To report errors or bugs that you find in this course material please post an issue at https://github.com/bradleyboehmke/uc-bana-7025/issues.

It will also provide you with some tips for getting help as you start writing R code and differentiating errors, warnings, and messages (because we will experience these daily!). 3.1 Learning objectives Upon completing this module you will: Understand the difference between R and RStudio. Have R and RStudio installed on your computer. Be able to navigate the RStudio IDE. Know how to get help as you first start learning R. Differentiate errors, warnings, and messages. Know what additional resources are available to go deeper. 3.2 R vs. RStudio When students first learn about R and RStudio, they are often confused on how the two differentiate. R is a programming language that runs computations, while RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. An analogy used by Ismay and Kim (2019) helps put this into perspective. “R is like a car’s engine while RStudio is like a car’s dashboard…just as the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio’s interface makes using R much easier as well.” Figure 3.1: Analogy of difference between R and RStudio (Ismay and Kim 2019) It is important to note that one can write R and do nearly everything you are going to do in this course without using RStudio. However, RStudio has lots of features that make writing, executing, and organizing your R code so much easier. Moreover, realize that there are other IDEs and platforms that you can use (i.e. VS code, Radiant, jupyter) to write and execute R code; however, RStudio has become the defacto IDE for R and is heavily used throughout the R community. Since RStudio has lots of features, it takes time to learn them. A good resource to learn more about RStudio are the R Studio Essentials collection of videos. 3.3 Installing R and RStudio It is important that you install R first and then install RStudio. You can download and install R from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. It is highly recommended to install a precompiled binary distribution for your operating system (OS); follow these instructions: Go to https://cloud.r-project.org/ Select the installer for your operating system: If you are a Windows user: Click on “Download R for Windows”, then click on “base”, then click on the Download link. If you are macOS user: Click on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”, then under “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of April 25, 2022 was R-4.2.0. If you are a Linux user: Click on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup. Follow the instructions of the installer. Next, you can download RStudio’s IDE by following these instructions: Go to RStudio for desktop https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Scroll down to “Installers for Supported Platforms” near the bottom of the page. Select the install file for your OS. Follow the instructions of the installer. Installing R and RStudio should be fairly straightforward. However, a great set of detailed step-by-step instructions is in Rafael Irizarry’s Introduction to Data Science book (Irizarry 2019). After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you’ll have two new programs (also called applications) you can open. The R application icon looks like the left image below while the RStudio icon looks like the right image. We’ll always work in RStudio and not in the R application so be sure to select the correct icon. Figure 3.2: Use the RStudio icon (right) and not the R icon (left) to launch your R project. If your OS allows, pin the RStudio icon to your desktop or Dock and keep the R icon in another location (i.e. Applications for Mac users). This makes it natural and efficient to always go to the RStudio icon on your desktop for launching the program. After you open RStudio, you should see something similar to the following image. Note that slight differences might exist depending on the version of your RStudio interface. Figure 3.3: RStudio interface to R. You are now ready to start programming! 3.4 Understanding the RStudio IDE The RStudio IDE is where all the action happens. There are four fundamental windows in the IDE, each with their own purpose. I discuss each briefly below but I highly suggest Oscar Torres-Reyna’s Introduction to RStudio for a thorough understanding of the console1. Figure 3.4: The four fundamental windows within the RStudio IDE 3.4.1 Script Editor The top left window is where your script files will display. There are multiple forms of script files but the basic one to start with is the .R file. To create a new file you use the File » New File menu. To open an existing file you use either the File » Open File… menu or the Recent Files menu to select from recently opened files. RStudio’s source editor includes a variety of productivity enhancing features including syntax highlighting, code completion, multiple-file editing, and find/replace. A good introduction to the script editor was written by RStudio’s Josh Paulson2. The script editor is a great place to put code you care about. Keep experimenting in the console, but once you have written code that works and does what you want, put it in the script editor. RStudio will automatically save the contents of the editor when you quit RStudio, and will automatically load it when you re-open. Nevertheless, it’s a good idea to save your scripts regularly and to back them up. To execute the code in the script editor you have two options: Place the cursor on the line that you would like to execute and execute Cmd/Ctrl + Enter. Alternatively, you could hit the Run button in the toolbar. If you want to run all lines of code in the script then you can highlight the lines you want to run and then execute one of the options in #1. Figure 3.5: Execute lines of code in your script with Cmd/Ctrl + Enter or using the Run button. 3.4.2 Workspace Environment The top right window is the workspace environment which captures much of your your current R working environment and includes any user-defined objects (vectors, matrices, data frames, lists, functions). When saving your R working session, these are the components along with the script files that will be saved in your working directory, which is the default location for all file inputs and outputs. To get or set your working directory so you can direct where your files are saved: # returns path for the current working directory getwd() # set the working directory to a specified directory setwd(&quot;path/of/directory&quot;) For example, if I call getwd() the file path “/Users/b294776/Desktop” is returned. If I want to set the working directory to the “Workspace” folder within the “Desktop” directory I would use setwd(\"/Users/b294776/Desktop/Workspace\"). Now if I call getwd() again it returns “/Users/b294776/Desktop/Workspace”. An alternative solution is to go to the following location in your toolbar Session » Set Working Directory » Choose Directory and select the directory of choice (much easier!). The workspace environment will also list your user defined objects such as vectors, matrices, data frames, lists, and functions. For example, if you type the following in your console: x &lt;- 2 y &lt;- 3 You will now see x and y listed in your workspace environment. To identify or remove the objects (i.e. vectors, data frames, user defined functions, etc.) in your current R environment: # list all objects ls() # identify if an R object with a given name is present exists(&quot;x&quot;) # remove defined object from the environment rm(x) # you can remove multiple objects rm(x, y) # basically removes everything in the working environment -- use with caution! rm(list = ls()) If you have a lot of objects in your workspace environment you can use the 🧹 icon in the workspace environment tab to clear out everything. You can also view previous commands in the workspace environment by clicking the History tab, by simply pressing the up arrow on your keyboard, or by typing into the console: # default shows 25 most recent commands history() # show 100 most recent commands history(100) # show entire saved history history(Inf) 3.4.3 Console The bottom left window contains the console. You can code directly in this window but it will not save your code. It is best to use this window when you are simply wanting to perform calculator type functions. This is also where your outputs will be presented when you run code in your script. Go ahead and type the following in your console: 2 * 3 + 8 / 2 3.4.4 Misc. Displays The bottom right window contains multiple tabs. The Files tab allows you to see which files are available in your working directory. The Plots tab will display any plots/graphics that are produced by your code. The Packages tab will list all packages downloaded to your computer and also the ones that are loaded (more on this later). And the Help tab allows you to search for topics you need help on and will also display any help responses (more on this later as well). 3.4.5 Workspace Options &amp; Shortcuts There are multiple options available for you to set and customize both R and your RStudio console. For R, you can read about, and set, available options for the current R session with the following code. For now you don’t need to worry about making any adjustments, just know that many options do exist. # learn about available options help(options) # view current option settings options() # change a specific option (i.e. number of digits to print on output) options(digits=3) For a thorough tutorial regarding the RStudio console and how to customize different components check out this tutorial. You can also find the RStudio console cheatsheet shown below by going to Help menu » Cheatsheets. As with most computer programs, there are numerous keyboard shortcuts for working with the console. To access a menu displaying all the shortcuts in RStudio you can use option + shift + k. Within RStudio you can also access them in the Help menu » Keyboard Shortcuts Help. Figure 3.6: RStudio IDE cheat sheet. 3.4.6 Knowledge check Identify which working directory you are working out of. Create a folder on your computer titled Learning R. Within RStudio, set your working directory to this folder. Type pi in the console. Set the option to show 8 digits. Re-type pi in the console. Type ?pi in the console. Note that documentation on this object pops up in the Help tab in the Misc. Display. Now check out your code History tab. Create a new .R file and save this as my-first-script (note how this now appears in your Learning R folder). Type pi in line 1 of this script, option(digits = 8) in line 2, and pi again in line three. Execute this code one line at a time and then re-execute all lines at once. 3.5 Getting help The help documentation and support in R is comprehensive and easily accessible from the the console. 3.5.1 General Help To leverage general help resources you can use: # provides general help links help.start() # searches the help system for documentation matching a given character string help.search(&quot;linear regression&quot;) Note that the help.search(\"some text here\") function requires a character string enclosed in quotation marks. So if you are in search of time series functions in R, using help.search(\"time series\") will pull up a healthy list of vignettes and code demonstrations that illustrate packages and functions that work with time series data. For more direct help on functions that are installed on your computer you can use the following. Test these out in your console: help(mean) # provides details for specific function ?mean # provides same information as help(functionname) example(mean) # provides examples for said function Note that the help() and ? function calls only work for functions within loaded packages. You’ll understand what this means shortly. 3.5.2 Getting Help From the Web Typically, a problem you may be encountering is not new and others have faced, solved, and documented the same issue online. The following resources can be used to search for online help. Although, I typically just Google the problem and find answers relatively quickly. RSiteSearch(\"key phrase\"): searches for the key phrase in help manuals and archived mailing lists on the R Project website. Stack Overflow: a searchable Q&amp;A site oriented toward programming issues. 75% of my answers typically come from Stack Overflow. Cross Validated: a searchable Q&amp;A site oriented toward statistical analysis. RStudio Community: a community for all things R and RStudio where you can get direct answers to your problems and also give back by helping to solve and answer other’s questions. R-seek: a Google custom search that is focused on R-specific websites R-bloggers: a central hub of content collected from over 500 bloggers who provide news and tutorials about R. Twitter has a thriving R community (#rstats) and is definitely worth following. However, it is not the place to ask for help on specific code functionality. 3.5.3 Knowledge check Does help.start() provide a link to an introduction to R manual? Does R’s mode function compute the statistical mode? Review at least 5 Stack Overflow questions about R. 3.6 Errors, warnings, and messages One thing that intimidates new R users (and new programmers in general) is when they run into errors, warnings, and messages. R reports errors, warnings, and messages in the following way. Don’t worry about what the code is doing, just get familiar with the differences in how errors, warnings, and messages are reported. Errors: When the red text is a legitimate error, it will be prefaced with “Error in…” and will try to explain what went wrong. Generally when there’s an error, the code will not run. Think of errors as a red traffic light: something is wrong! For references on common errors, check out the following links by Noam Ross, David Smith, and Chester Ismay. # Example of an error 1 + &#39;a&#39; ## Error in 1 + &quot;a&quot;: non-numeric argument to binary operator Warnings: Warning messages will be prefaced with “Warning:” and R will try to explain why there’s a warning. Generally your code will still work, but with some caveats. Think of warnings as a yellow traffic light: everything is working, but watch out/pay attention. Typically when you get a warning you want to figure out what is throwing the warning because the end result may not be what you had intended! x &lt;- 1:2 y &lt;- 1:3 # Example of a warning x + y ## Warning in x + y: longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object ## length ## [1] 2 4 4 Messages: When the text doesn’t start with either “Error” or “Warning”, it’s just a friendly message. You’ll often see these messages when you load R packages or make certain function calls. Think of messages as a green traffic light: everything is working fine and keep on going! # Example of a message library(completejourney) 3.7 Exercises What differentiates R and RStudio? What are the four main panes in RStudio? What function tells you what directory your are operating in? How could you change the directory to a new folder? How could you access R documentation to learn more about the lm() function?

Typically you have many tables of data, and you must combine them to answer the questions that you’re interested in. Collectively, multiple tables of data are called relational data because it is the relations, not just the individual datasets, that are important. Moreover, as data scientists work across multiple datasets they often find themselves working with different data types (i.e. numeric, categorical, date-times) and this can present many challenges. In this module we’ll explore how to use different join operations when working with relational data along with introduce additional Tidyverse packages that will simplify working with different data types. 13.1 Learning objectives By the end of this module you should be able to: Describe and apply the different join operations.

Formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer, the DRY principle states that “every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.” This principle has been widely adopted to imply that you should not duplicate code. Although the principle was meant to be far grander than that, there’s plenty of merit behind this slight misinterpretation. Removing duplication is an important part of writing efficient code and reducing potential errors. First, reduced duplication of code can improve computing time and reduces the amount of code writing required. Second, less duplication results in less creating and saving of unnecessary objects. Inefficient code invariably creates copies of objects you have little interest in other than to feed into some future line of code; this wrecks havoc on properly managing your objects as it basically results in a global environment charlie foxtrot! Less duplication also results in less editing. When changes to code are required, duplicated code becomes tedious to edit and invariably mistakes or fat-fingering occur in the cut-and-paste editing process which just lengthens the editing that much more. Thus, minimizing duplication by writing efficient code is important to becoming a data analyst and in this module you learn to improve your code efficiency with control flow, iteration, and functions. 21.1 Learning objectives By the end of this module you should be able to: Use a variety of control statements to control the flow of code evaluation.
