Being able to create visualizations (graphical representations) of data is a key step in data analysis. In this module you will learn to use the **ggplot2** library to create the meaningful, elegant, and finely tuned data visualizations. You will also learn to combine data transformation, manipulation, and visualization to explore your data and start extracting key insights.

## Learning objectives
