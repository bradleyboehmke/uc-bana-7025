## Course Description

Welcome to Data Wrangling with R! This course provides an intensive, hands-on introduction to Data Wrangling with the R programming language. You will learn the fundamental skills required to acquire, munge, transform, manipulate, and visualize data in a computing environment that fosters reproducibility.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successfully completing this course, you will be able to:

* Perform your data analysis in a literate programming environment
* Manage different types of data
* Manage different data structures
* Import and export data
* Index, subset, reshape and transform your data
* Compute descriptive statistics
* Visualize data
* Make your code efficient by using control statements & iteration
* Write your own functions

...all with R!
