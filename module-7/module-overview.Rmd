# Overview

Video that introduces module -- use introductory ML section/slides

Now that you are equipped with powerful programming tools we can finally move into the world of applied modeling. In this module we'll build on your new tools of data wrangling and programming to fit, analyze, and understand different applied modeling techniques. First, you will gain a basic understanding of discovering relationships across variables and using models for data exploration. Then you will learn about the machine learning process and how to start applying it with R. This will give you the foundation to start building your own machine learning toolbox.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Identify covariate relationships within your data.
- Explain the modeling process and apply it within your R workflow.
- Apply and explain the results of a few foundational machine learning algorithms.
